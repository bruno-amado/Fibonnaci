# Fibonnaci
This is part of a exercise that I did... 

The logic is simple.
0 0 1                so, a = 0 , b = 0 and c = 1 
a b c                  For this to work. We need to focus in one variable. That's the one that we will print out.
                       In this case, is C.
                       
0 1 1                   Now, The fibonacci sequece is the sum of previous numbers in sequece ( 1 1 2 3 5 8)                       
a b c                                  so, 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3 , 2 + 3 = 5, 5 + 3 = 8
                        We focus on C so c will be the one that will be equal to the sum of the other two variables( c = a + b)
                        Now to complete Fibonacci requirements, we need to make a and b the previous numbers so thats why (in sequence)
                        a = b 
                        b = c 
                        and here c = a + b 
1 1 2            -- 
a b c            --
         
1 2 3 
a b c 

And that's it . Ez i Guess.
